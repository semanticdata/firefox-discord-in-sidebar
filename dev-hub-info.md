## Description

<b>Introduction</b>
This Firefox Extension displays the [Discord] within the Firefox sidebar. It adds a new section to the sidebar which contains the [Discord] web app. It also provides a shortcut, and toggle button.

<b>How to Use</b>
Toggle the sidebar by pressing <b>Alt+Shift+6</b>.
This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> [Discord] in Sidebar -> Options. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the sidebar.

<b>How to Unlock Firefox Sidebar Width</b>
The sidebar's width is <i>locked by default</i> in Firefox. Unfortunately, the sidebar is very restricted and I can only do so much to enhance the functionality of this extension. I put together a step-by-step guide on how to unlock the sidebar width on my <a href="https://miguelpimentel.do/unlock-firefox-sidebar/">Blog</a>.

<b>Disclaimer</b>
This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use [Discord] on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their web app in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to [Discord] in any way.
