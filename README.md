# Discord in Sidebar

A Firefox WebExtension to display [Discord](https://discord.com/) in the sidebar.

This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Discord web app.

Press `Alt+Shift+6` to open. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Discord in Sidebar -> Options.

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Discord on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their webapp in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Discord in any way.
