## Introduction

A Firefox WebExtension to display Discord within the Firefox sidebar. This extension adds a new section to the sidebar which contains the Discord web app. It also adds a shortcut, and a button toggle within the toolbar.

## How to Use

1. Toggle the sidebar by pressing _`Alt+Shift+6`_. This shortcut can be changed by going to _`Add-ons` → `Discord in Sidebar` → `Options`_.
2. If you prefer buttons over shortcuts, there is a toolbar button you can press to toggle the sidebar.

## How to Unlock Firefox Sidebar Width

The sidebar's width is _locked by default_ in Firefox. Unfortunately, the sidebar is very restrictive and I can only do so much to enhance the functionality of this extension. I put together a step-by-step guide on how to unlock it over at [my website](https://forgetful.dev/guides/unlock-firefox-sidebar/).

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Discord on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their webapp in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Discord in any way.
